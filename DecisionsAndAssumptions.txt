Our decisions and assumptions while making this project.

MUST:
- Must be possible to add an appointment
- In this appointment i must be possible to choose the room number in wich the appointment takes place
- It must be possible to put in a time and date for the appointment.
- There must be validation so that no room is doublebooked.
- It must be possible to choose, what room the appointment takes place in
- It must be possible to add clinicians to the appointment
- It must be possible to add first- and last name of both the mother and father of the appointment,
  however it must not be a requirement that the dad is known
- It should be possible to cancel an appointemt 
- It must be possible to see all appointments scheduled for at least five days forward
- It must be possible to see all clinicians attached to the appointment
- It must be possible to see the current status of any given room, the infomation of the patients in the room 
  and the clinicians assigned to that appointment. 
- It should be possible, when parents are moved to a maternity room for the baby info to be added.

SHOULD:
- It should be possible to valtidate the clinicians schedule so that they are not double 
booked - however this will not be implemented at this time.
- It should be possible to remove clinicians from an appointemt - however this will not be implemented at this time.
- The application should validate CPR-numbers - this has been implemented
- It should be possible to add new clinicians - this has been implemented

DECISIONS:
- When the parents are in a restroom, this indicates that the mother has not given birth yet
- When the appointment is then removed at then added as new appoint in birthroom this means that the birth is ongoing
- When the appointment then is removed again and added as a new appointment to maternityroom, this is marked as the birth is finished and it is 
possible to add the infomation of the child
